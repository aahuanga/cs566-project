            <h3>1. Problem Statement + Motivation</h3>
            <p class="text-body">Color psychology plays a major role in a customer’s decision to purchase a product.
                The Amazon Product Color Guide states that “90% of snap judgments about products are based on color alone, 
                especially in the context of branding and product design.” With major clothing retailers like Amazon, Walmart, and 
                Etsy capitalizing on the growing online market, color is a significant factor in how customers perceive a product, 
                especially when they cannot physically try on or touch the clothes. Despite the growth of the industry, 
                online sales still account for a minority of total retail purchases. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in the first 
                two months of 2025, online sales made approximately 20% of total retail purchases, while in-person sales accounted for 
                the remaining 80%. A key limiting factor is the lack of individualized shopping experiences. Customers and businesses 
                need a tool that can tailor the online shopping experience. We propose a color analysis application that allows users to 
                change the colors of the clothes a person is wearing in an image. This will enable better visualization of clothing and 
                showcase how products look on an actual person. From a seller’s perspective, the tool allows for more efficient marketing 
                without costly, time-consuming photoshoots. From a customer’s perspective, it helps guide purchasing decisions by 
                visualizing how the product looks on a person in a variety of colors.

            <h3>2. Approach</h3>
            <h4>Shirt Detection and Segmentation</h4>
                <p class="text-body">To detect the shirt and implement segmentation, we will follow the method as described in Hilsmann and Eisert’s research paper. This consists of taking all the pixels within a picture and normalizing them based on the intensity of the lighting which removes brightness as a factor. For example, if a t-shirt has shadows or inconsistent illumination, then the normalization process allows for easier segmentation. Then, an algorithm will take the largest cluster of standardized pixel values, identifying it as the shirt. This is dependent upon the shirt being the “primary” object within the picture as otherwise, it would be too difficult to determine which blobs make up the shirt. Once the t-shirt region is discovered, we will then have a binary mask allowing for future processing.</p>
            <h4>Color Detection & Transformation</h4>
                <p class="text-body">We want to change the color of the shirt while preserving texture and shading in the image. By transforming the image pixels to HSV (hue, saturation, value) color space, we can modify the hue (color) independently from brightness and intensity. This allows us to replace the hue within the clothing region to the specific color of choice without impacting shaded and textured areas in the image. We can also adjust saturation and value to look more natural.</p>
            <h4>Color Analysis</h4>
                <p class="text-body">The user will be able to preview the clothing in a variety of colors. This will help them visually analyze which color they prefer. We also aim to algorithmically identify which color suits the image individual the most based on factors such as skin tone, warm/cool undertones, and more. </p>

            <h3>3. Implementation</h3>
                <h4>Segmentation Algorithm</h4>
                    <p class="text-body">
                        We considered a variety of different algorithms to determine the segmentation of the shirt from the rest of the image. 
                        These included some such as K-Means Clustering, Graph Cut, and Meanshift Segmentation. Ultimately, we decided to implement the K-Means 
                        algorithm for its balance of high efficiency and accuracy comparable to the others. To further increase accuracy, we utilized a GrabCut to "bind"
                        the segmentation to the shirt area more tightly. 
                    </p>
                <h4>Color Replacement</h4>
                    <p class="text-body">
                        A color replacement interface is in initial development to let users interactively change the colors of segmented shirt images. In future updates, color changes will be applied directly on the full image, not just the image of the extracted shirt segment. The GUI enables users to select from predefined color swatches. To preserve the underlying texture and shading of the segmented regions, the recoloring process is performed in the HSV color space, where only the hue channel is modified while the saturation and value channels remain unchanged. The interface updates the displayed image in real time, allowing users to experiment with different colors efficiently.

            <h3>5. Future Work</h3>
                <p class="text-body">
                    In the future, any further work done on this should focus on first creating accurate segmentations even under adverse conditions (such as non-optimal backgrounds). 
                    Additionally, it would be helpful to have a proper way of evaluating results quantitatively to ensure the results generated are truly accurate and represent a 
                    valid color transformation for articles of clothing.
